#summary HOWTO use win-in-kvm

= Introduction =

This short HOWTO explains how to use win-in-kvm to run Windows programs without having to stare at the Windows desktop.

Before anyone starts asking "Why don't you use WINE?", I can't. I can't use WINE with a 64-bit processor in 64-bit mode, OK?


= Details =

  * *First step*: download and install KVM:

kvm.qumranet.com

  * *Second step*: make sure there's a way to run KVM without having to be root:

  * *Third step*: install Windows 2003 Server or any Windows with decent Terminal Services support (*make sure you are able to run KVM without being root*):

> qemu-system-x86_64 -cdrom <path_to_your_iso> -m 512 -localtime <path_to_your_image> -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user

You can create your image using `qemu-img`:

> qemu-img create -f qcow2 <image_name> <image_size>

For example:

> qemu-img create -f qcow2 win2003server.img 10G

  * *Fourth step*: make sure you have either Remote Desktop or Terminal Services active:

Right click on 'My Computer' -> 'Remote' -> 'Enable Remote Desktop on this computer' -> 'Select remote users' -> Check if your user has permissions -> 'OK' -> 'OK' 

  * *Fifth step*: make sure you have rdesktop installed!

  * *Sixth step*: use win-in-kvm!

> win-in-kvm.py add <name_of_vm> "-localtime <path_to_image> -m 512 -redir tcp:3389::3389 -redir udp:3389::3389 -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user"

> win-in-kvm run <name_of_vm> notepad.exe


= TODO =

  * Further shield user from QEMU commandline (possibly using KVM Python script)

  * Check if the VM is already launched

  * Detect if VM has finished booting

  * Provide a known working directory in Windows accessible from Linux

  * Automate Windows install?
